## Rendering

Render the column itself just like a `Container`.

### Column widths

#### Fixed pixel width

The width is assigned by a specific author-specificied width. These colums are first in terms of priority of getting space allocated.

#### Auto

The width is determined by the content inside the column, but limited by the total remaining space. These columns are second in terms of priority of getting space allocated.

#### Stretch / weighted number

These columns distribute the final remaining space according to their weighted number. If simply set to `stretch`, assign a weight of `1`. These colums are last in terms of priority of getting space allocated.
